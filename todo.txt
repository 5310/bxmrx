# X	v0:
	
	# X	Set-up project.
	# X	Write basic markup with structure.
	# X	Set up basic validation in HTML and CSS.
	# X	Bind jQuery placeholder hooks for the relevant elements.
	
# X	v1:

	# X	Implement the submit function:
		# X	If form with urls is valid, compile it into a list in order,
		# X	Store in OKV under a random unique prefixed key.
		# X	Show the read-only url field with the new bxmrx url, focus and select it.
		
	# X	Smoothly add row with add button.
	
	# X	Submit button should be disabled/enabled when the form is not/is valid. 
		-	But it needs to update on each granular change; `.change()` only woks on focus-change.
		-	Made use of the following compound events: `.bind("propertychange keyup input paste", handler)`!
	
	# X	Smoothly delete will clear if only remaining entry. And delete otherwise.
	
	# Smoothly show or hide generated URL text.

# X	v2:

	# X	Markup display mode. Don't forge to add links to create 'marks on the footer.
	
	# X	Load bookmarked URL:
		# X	If supplied url argument of a prefixless OKV key present, show loading message.
		# X	Read url-list from OKV.
			# X	If successful, populate and show display-list with urls, and button to launch them all.
			# X	If not, show error message.

# X	v3:

	# X	Style the shit out of the thing. 
	# X	Remember not to wrongly highlight empty or focused only text.


#	v4:
	
	@ X	Convert generated code element into a div.
	
	@	Make tab cycling work intuitively.
	
	#	Clean code.
	#	Get a readme, with credits, apologetics, etc.
